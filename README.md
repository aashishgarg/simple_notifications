# Simple Notifications

A very simple gem providing the notifications functionality to any model in a Rails application.

### Installation

Add following line to your gemfile

```ruby
gem 'simple_notifications'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_notifications

### Usage

Run the simple notifications generator

```ruby
rails generate simple_notifications:install
```
This will generate two files in your rails project

* simple_notifications.rb - An initializer file.
* Migration files - Required for recording notifications.

Then run

```ruby
rails db:migrate
``` 

Add following line to the model for which notifications functionality is required. Here [Post] is the model which is the base for notification to happen i.e Event is performed on Post. 

```ruby
notify sender: :author,
       receivers: :followers,
       actions: [:follow, :unfollow, :update, :create, :destroy],
       notify_message: :message_method,
       before_notify: :before_notify_method,
       after_notify: :after_notify_method,
       before_delivered: :before_delivered_method,
       after_delivered: :after_delivered_method,
       before_read: :before_read_method,
       after_read: :after_read_method
``` 
Here [receivers] will be notified that an event was done by [sender] on [post] entity with a message that is configurable.

You can also provide ActiveRecord::Base object or ActiveRecord::Relation objects as 

```ruby
notify sender: :author, receivers: User.all
notify sender: User.first, receivers: [:followers, User.all]
```

Here [:sender] is the [belongs_to] association with [:post] while :followers is the [:has_many] associations for the [:post] model through [:sender] model which needs to be notified.

### Notification Models

```ruby
SimpleNotifications::Record
SimpleNotifications::Delivery
```
Here assumption is that one event performed by [:sender] on entity [:post] will have one type of notification and it needs to be delivered to many [:receivers].

### Scopes

```ruby
SimpleNotifications::Record.read
SimpleNotifications::Record.unread
```
